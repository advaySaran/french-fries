# french-fries
Firstly take 1 extra-large potato or 2 large potatoes or 3 medium potatoes (315 grams). Rinse well in water and then peel the potato.
Then slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness. Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato. You can also use a french fry cutter if you have it.
